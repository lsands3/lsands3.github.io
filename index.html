	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p class="intro">This page was created in February of 2020. At this point in my life, I am in love with an album called <strong>"Heard It In A Past Life"</strong> by one of my new artists, Maggie Rogers. I'm not completely sure why, but for some reason, I just feel like I connect with her and her music in a deep way. There is something so raw and honest about her lyrics discussing love, life, emotional depth, and the modern human condition. She has such a unique and admirable perspective and point of view in her writing and that is seen from the first track to the final seconds of this breathtaking album. That is why I have created this page. I am hereby declaring my love and appreciation for her not only as an artist, but as a human being too.</p>
	
	<h2>Fun Facts About Maggie</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Her Birthday is April 25th (3 Days Before Mine) which makes us both Tauruses!</li>
		<li>She graduated from New York University after being discovered by Pharrell in a master class for the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music.</li>
		<li>In 2020, she was nominated for her first Grammy for Best New Artist. She was <em>robbed</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>One of my FAVORITE moments</h2>
	<p>On November 3rd, 2018, she performed her song <strong>"Fallingwater"</strong> on Saturday Night Live. Not only was this perfromance great, in a way, it represented her much deserved breakthrough into mainstream media. </p>
